# Sprint Log

## Sprint 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Created src/, docs/, tests/ directories
- Added README.md with goals and principles
- Initialized package.json for Node.js
- Ran npm install successfully
- Committed changes

## Sprint 2: Audio Library Selection (Completed)
- Researched and selected node-record-lpcm16 for Windows compatibility
- Added dependency to package.json
- Committed changes

## Sprint 3: Basic Audio Recording (Completed)
- Implemented AudioRecorder class with start/stop methods
- Uses node-record-lpcm16 for recording to file
- Committed changes

## Sprint 4: Idle Listening (Completed)
- Added idleListen method with silence detection and auto-restart
- Uses threshold and silence options for low-power listening
- Committed changes

## Sprint 5: Recording Tests (Completed)
- Added Jest as test framework
- Created unit tests for AudioRecorder class
- Updated test script
- Committed changes

## Sprint 6: As-Directed Pushes (Completed)
- Relaxed `.instructions.md` rules 2 and 3 to allow user-authorized remote configuration and pushes
- Added an "As-Directed Pushes" subsection with guardrails (confirm remote/branch, no force/all-branch pushes, no remote reconfiguration without direction)
- Updated the Commit Locally section to mirror the new policy
- Files modified: `.instructions.md`, `docs/sprint-log.md`
- Known limitations: HTML doc mirror (rule 6) not yet generated for any sprint; tracked as deferred debt
- Why: a public GitHub remote (`origin/develop`) was set up out-of-band per explicit user direction; the rules needed to reflect that this is now permitted when directed

## Sprint 7: Stabilization (Completed)
- Fixed `src/audioRecorder.js`: closed the dangling `class AudioRecorder { ... }` body (the previous file was a SyntaxError on parse) and added the missing `stop()` method that several tests were already referencing
- Created `src/index.js`: a minimal CLI entry that prints help by default and supports `record <path>` and `idle <path>` subcommands with graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown. Resolves `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` from `npm start`
- Rewrote `tests/audioRecorder.test.js`: now mocks `node-record-lpcm16` and `fs` so no real hardware or filesystem is touched. Covers construction, option merging, start/stop lifecycle, double-start guard, stop-without-start guard, and idle-listen chunk initiation
- Corrected `package.json` dependency range for `node-record-lpcm16` from `^1.0.5` (never published) to `^1.0.1` (latest real version)
- Hardened the `test` script to `jest --ci --forceExit` so CI/non-TTY runs don't hang on watch mode or stray timer handles
- Added a `.gitignore` covering `node_modules/`, audio artifacts (`*.wav`, `*.mp3`, `*.flac`, `recordings/`), logs, coverage, and common editor/OS files
- Files modified: `package.json`, `src/audioRecorder.js`, `tests/audioRecorder.test.js`, `docs/sprint-log.md`
- Files added: `src/index.js`, `.gitignore`, `package-lock.json`
- Validation: `node --check` clean on all source files; `npm test` reports 7/7 passing in ~0.3s
- Known limitations:
  - `idleListen()` still has a latent issue where the silence-restart `setTimeout` may fire after `stop()` is called and re-open a new file stream. Out of scope for this sprint; flagged for Phase 3 work
  - HTML doc mirror (rule 6) remains deferred debt
  - Tests mock both the recording library and `fs`, so they validate wiring but not real audio capture; integration coverage will need a real-device sprint later
- Why: the codebase committed at end of Phase 2 did not parse, had no entry file, had tests that referenced an undefined method, and pinned a nonexistent dep version. This sprint makes Phase 2 honestly complete before Phase 3 work begins

## Sprint 8: HTML Mirror Catch-Up (Completed)
- Paid down workflow rule 6 debt that had accumulated for seven sprints (no HTML mirrors had been generated for any prior sprint)
- Added `tools/build-html.js`: small Node generator that converts the project's markdown docs into self-contained HTML using `marked` (no JS framework, single inline `<style>` block, light/dark color-scheme support)
- Added `npm run docs:html` script so future sprints can regenerate mirrors in one command
- Added `marked` (^16.x line as resolved by npm) to `devDependencies` only; no runtime impact
- Generated initial mirrors at `docs/html/README.html`, `docs/html/instructions.html`, `docs/html/sprint-log.html`. A future `docs/sprint-plan.md` is wired in as an optional source so it auto-mirrors when created
- Files added: `tools/build-html.js`, `docs/html/README.html`, `docs/html/instructions.html`, `docs/html/sprint-log.html`
- Files modified: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `docs/sprint-log.md`
- Validation: `npm run docs:html` reports `ok` for all required sources; `npm test` 7/7 passing
- Known limitations:
  - Generator is one-way (md -> html). It does not roundtrip edits made to HTML
  - No anchor cross-links between mirrored docs yet; each HTML file is standalone
- Why: rule 6 of `.instructions.md` mandates HTML mirrors every sprint; doing this once via tooling closes the debt and removes friction for future sprints

## Sprint 9: Idle-Listen Stop Guard (Completed)
- Closed the latent restart-after-stop bug flagged in Sprint 7's known limitations
- Added an `idle` lifecycle flag to `AudioRecorder` that tracks "idle-listening mode" independently of the current chunk's `recording` handle
- `idleListen()` sets `idle=true`; the silence-end callback now only schedules the next chunk if `idle` is still true
- `stop()` now accepts being called from idle mode (previously threw if `recording` was null even when the next chunk had not yet been opened); it clears `idle` first to short-circuit any in-flight restart
- `start()` and `idleListen()` both reject being called when either `recording` or `idle` is active (closes the previously-silent overlap)
- Added two tests:
  - `idleListen() rejects a second concurrent call`
  - `stop() during idle gap prevents the next chunk from starting` (uses jest fake timers to simulate the 100ms silence-restart gap)
- Files modified: `src/audioRecorder.js`, `tests/audioRecorder.test.js`, `docs/sprint-log.md`, HTML mirrors regenerated
- Validation: `npm test` 9/9 passing
- Known limitations:
  - Real device behavior still unverified; the new guard is wiring only. Mini-sprints in the upcoming `docs/sprint-plan.md` will validate against hardware
- Why: Sprint 7 acknowledged this latent bug but deferred it. Fixing it now closes the catch-up debt and gives the Phase 3 work a known-good lifecycle to build on

## Sprint 10: Mini-Sprint Plan for Working Audio (Completed)
- Created `docs/sprint-plan.md` enumerating eight tightly-scoped mini-sprints (MS-1 through MS-8) that take audio capture from "code compiles" to "real WAVs from a real mic on this Windows box"
- Ordered as listening first (MS-1 sox probe, MS-2 device enumeration, MS-3 live level meter) then recording (MS-4 WAV output, MS-5 fixed duration, MS-6 rolling idle chunks, MS-7 Whisper-aligned defaults, MS-8 chunk metadata sidecars)
- Each mini-sprint specifies: goal, files touched, concrete steps, validation procedure, acceptance criteria, rollback approach, and risk notes
- Documents the two known-broken aspects of current audio code that need fixing during the track: `start()` writes raw PCM not WAV; `idleListen()` appends multiple silence-chunks to one file
- Includes an explicit out-of-scope list (transcription, summarization, search, GPU, etc.) so the next planning pass starts from a clean boundary
- The HTML generator (Sprint 8) already had `docs/sprint-plan.md` pre-wired as an optional source, so this turn picked it up automatically
- Files added: `docs/sprint-plan.md`, `docs/html/sprint-plan.html`
- Files modified: `docs/sprint-log.md`, plus regenerated `docs/html/sprint-log.html` and `docs/html/instructions.html` from the same `npm run docs:html` invocation
- Validation: `npm run docs:html` reports `ok` for all sources including the new plan; `npm test` 9/9 passing (no code changes this sprint)
- Why: the user asked for a concrete plan after the catch-up sprints. Writing the plan as a committed doc means the next sessions resume from a written shared understanding rather than from chat history

Next: MS-1 — sox dependency probe. After that the track proceeds linearly through MS-2..MS-8.

## Sprint 11 (MS-1): Sox Dependency Probe (Completed)
- Added `tools/check-audio-deps.js`: spawns `sox --version`, handles `ENOENT` by printing platform-specific install hints (winget / chocolatey / sourceforge for Windows, brew for macOS, apt/dnf/pacman for Linux), and exits non-zero so CI / npm script chains can react
- Added `npm run audio:check` script
- Expanded the README Setup section with a numbered list including the audio prereq step, plus a dedicated "Audio Capture Prerequisites" subsection with per-OS install commands
- Files added: `tools/check-audio-deps.js`
- Files modified: `package.json`, `README.md`, `docs/sprint-log.md`, regenerated HTML mirrors
- Validation:
  - `node --check tools/check-audio-deps.js` clean
  - Ran `npm run audio:check` with sox absent: exited 1, printed install hints (matches MS-1 acceptance criteria for the FAIL path)
  - Installed `ChrisBagwell.SoX` v14.4.2 via winget; refreshed PATH; re-ran `npm run audio:check`: exited 0, reported `sox: SoX v14.4.2` (matches OK path)
  - `npm test` 9/9 still passing (no source changes)
- Known limitations:
  - Probe only detects `sox` itself, not `sox-plugins` or codec libraries (irrelevant for plain WAV capture, may matter later for MP3/Opus output)
  - Probe does not attempt to repair PATH — it tells the user to do that themselves
  - SoX 14.4.2 is the last classic release (2015); a 14.7.x fork (`sox_ng`) is available via winget. Sticking with 14.4.2 since that is what `node-record-lpcm16` targets in its tests
- Why: the entire Phase 3A track depends on sox being callable. Failing fast with a clear message is the cheapest way to keep MS-2..MS-8 from producing confusing runtime errors

## Sprint 12 (MS-2): Device Enumeration (Completed)
- Added `src/audioDevices.js`: pure parser (`parseEnumeration`) plus a sox-spawning runner (`runSoxProbe` / `enumerateDevices`). Splits concerns so the parser is unit-testable without touching child_process
- The probe invokes `sox -V6 -t waveaudio __localrecorder_probe__ -n`. Sox emits its full device enumeration on stderr at -V6 verbosity before failing to open the bogus device; we discard the FAIL and keep the DBUG lines
- Regex: `/waveaudio:\s+Enumerating input device\s+(-?\d+):\s+"([^"]+)"/g`. Index -1 is reported by sox as the system default; tagged with `isDefault: true` in the result
- Added `node src/index.js devices` subcommand. Output is a small table: a left-aligned label column ("default" or the numeric index) and the device name
- Made `main()` in `src/index.js` async so future subcommands that need to await have a clean home; preserved synchronous-feeling exit codes
- Tests added in `tests/audioDevices.test.js`:
  - `parseEnumeration` extracts index/name/isDefault, returns `[]` for empty or unrelated text, tolerates CRLF + whitespace
  - `enumerateDevices` parses a mocked spawn result, throws a friendly error on ENOENT, returns `[]` when sox emits no enumeration lines
- Files added: `src/audioDevices.js`, `tests/audioDevices.test.js`
- Files modified: `src/index.js`, `docs/sprint-log.md`, regenerated HTML mirrors
- Validation:
  - `npm test` — 15/15 passing (9 previous + 6 new)
  - `node src/index.js devices` on this machine lists "default Microsoft Sound Mapper" and "0 Microphone (Mic-j5 WebCam JVCU1" with exit 0
  - `node src/index.js help` updated to advertise the new subcommand
- Known limitations:
  - Windows WaveAudio truncates input device names to 31 characters (an OS-level multimedia API limit), so long device names like "Microphone (Mic-j5 WebCam JVCU100)" arrive without their tail. Documented behavior, not a bug in our parser
  - The probe argument list is hardcoded for `waveaudio` (Windows-only). macOS would need `coreaudio` and Linux `alsa`/`pulseaudio`. Cross-platform device enumeration is deferred until MS-2 needs to run elsewhere
  - We discard the FAIL line from the bogus-device open. If sox future-changes that error to a non-zero exit before emitting the enumeration, the probe could return empty; covered by the empty-list test case
- Why: before MS-3 streams bytes off the default input, having a way to confirm "yes sox sees a mic, and yes it's the one I expect" makes hardware-level problems debuggable in seconds instead of by trial and error
